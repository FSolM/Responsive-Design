# Responsive Design

##### Project 6

#### A clone page implementing a responsive design approach

## About

This page clones focuses on the use of responsive design in the creation of a **webpage's layout** with a mobile first mentality, aside from the regular HTML elements. The main focus of the page was the responsiveness of the containers rather than the hole page.

## Details

**Clone:** [The Next Web Cover](https://thenextweb.com)

**Live Page:** [GitHub Hosting](https://fsolm.github.io/responsive-design/)

## Installation

All the necessary files are in the root directory, just open the HTML file.

## Known Issues

As mentioned earlier, the focus of the page was the responsiveness of the containers rather than the elements; this creates issues with the font size in smaller viewports. Also, the top stories containers may experience unexpected behaviours with viewports with smaller heights.

## Planned Implementations

None, the goal of this project was completed and it's not necessary to revisit it.
